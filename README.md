# Bangalore-Homes-Price-Prediction-System
This Data science project is a real estate price prediction site.
This Data science project is a real estate price prediction site.First I build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Secondly I wrote a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
